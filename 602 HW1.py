# This program gets three test scores and displays their average. It congratulates the user if the

test1 = int(input('Enter the score for test 1: '))
test2 = int(input('Enter the score for test 2: '))
# Added missing input for test3
test3 = int(input('Enter the score for test 3: '))  

# Calculate the average test score.
# Add parenthesis to ensure correct order of the operation
average = (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3 

# Print the average.

    print('That is a great average!')


#Q2
#The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width. Write a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles and prints to the user the area of both rectangles. 
L1=float(input('Enter the length of rectangle 1: '))
W1=float(input('Enter the width of rectangle 1: '))

L2=float(input('Enter the length of rectangle 2: '))
W2=float(input('Enter the width of rectangle 2: '))

Area1=L1*W1
Area2=L2*W2

print('The area of the 1st rectangle', Area1)
print('The area of the 2nd rectangle', Area2)

#Q3 
#Ask a user to enter their first name and their age and assign it to the variables name and age.
